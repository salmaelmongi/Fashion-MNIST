## Data will be found at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist

## Description:


This project focuses on experimenting with different neural network architectures for image classification on the Fashion-MNIST dataset. The goal is to evaluate the performance of various models and compare their accuracy in classifying fashion items.


## Dataset:


Fashion-MNIST is a dataset consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Each image is a grayscale image of size 28x28 pixels, representing various fashion items across 10 categories.

## Models Implemented:


*LeNet:*

Implementation of the classic LeNet-5 architecture for image classification.

*LeNet-5:*

A modified version of LeNet-5 with different hyperparameters and architectural changes.

*VGG19:*

Transfer learning using the VGG19 architecture pre-trained on ImageNet.

*AlexNet:*

A customized version of the AlexNet architecture for image classification.
